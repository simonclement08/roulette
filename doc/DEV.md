## GIT

- **Don't share your personnal information :**

To share config files in src/config/, their names need to be extent with .template (ex : connectBDD.php.template).

Then to modify locally with your personal information, copy the files without .template (ex : connectBDD.php), it will be ignored by git.

For more information look at .gitignore in the project.
