## Structure folder

- The index file on the root folder is the entry point

- The root of the project holds a few directories
  - /app – application folder
  - /config – configuration files : data, connection to the database ...
  - /doc - documentation
  - /lib – libraries
  - /public – files to be “downloaded” : CSS, JavaScripts and images ...



## GIT

**Don't share your personal information**

- To share config files in config folder, look at .gitignore
